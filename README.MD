## Summary
The crosstalk between brain infiltrating T cells and microglia in response to stroke remains elusive. Benakis et al. report that transcriptional signature of the stroke-associated microglia is reprogrammed by distinct T cell subpopulations. Engineered T cells overexpressing IL-10 administered four hours after stroke reinitiate microglial transcriptomic profile inducing a pro-regenerative environment.

## Single cell RNA sequencing experiment
CD45+CD11b+ cells sorted from the ipsilateral hemisphere in naïve mice or 5 d after stroke in WT and Rag1-/- (3 mice/condition) were used for single cell RNA sequencing (10x Genomics).
